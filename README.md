# Applied Time Series Analysis
This repo contains an adaptation of the notes on Time Series Analysis from Penn State, located at https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/.
The original course is given in R, but these notes use Python, Pandas, and Statsmodels in Jupyter Notebooks. Hopefully these notes are useful and educational.

Following the outline on the site above, the course covers the following topics:
* Understanding the characteristics of time series data
* Understanding moving average models and partial autocorrelation as foundations for analysis of time series data
* Exploratory Data Analysis - Trends in time series data
* Using smoothing and removing trends when working with time series data
* Understanding how periodograms are used with time series data
* Implementing ARMA and ARIMA time series models
* Identifying and interpreting various patterns for intervention effects
* Examining the analysis of repeated measures design
* Using ARCH and AR models in multivariate time series contexts
* Using spectral density estimation and spectral analysis
* Using fractional differencing and threshold models with time series data
